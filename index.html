                Today is 11th September, and here I am thinking about what to give you for your birthday and I am completely blank
                <p>So basically, I wanted to give you something personal, not just order online something  and such stuff. I wanted to spend time on this.<br><br>
                    Then, I thought about a lot of things, maybe a personal playlist, but there is nothing new to that. So, here is something I made with loooooooots of love. This is a little bit selfish because it contains all those pics that I love of you the most, but yeah. I wanted to spend today with you, but then, I want to spend everyday with you. But since I cant be there, 
                    I am giving you this little gem filled with all my love and thoughts. Go ahead. <br><br> (And you really are hot in this pic).

                Here's to the journey from a dumb old kid who used to be someone I saw for just a week in the whole year to someone I now can't imagine going a single day without seeing. I have told this before, but never did I imagine once that you would be someone with whom I would fall in love with(and damn I fell hard), but then, maybe it is destiny. You made me believe in destiny.&#128149;
                <br><br>So, you had a crush on me huh?&#128527; I dont know if it is weird, but I actually find that to be sweet. Like man, come on, think about how that story unwinded. The day I heard it, I was taken aback and I really didnt know how to respond. It put the biggest smile on my face.&#128513;
                <br><br>I find it so amusing that after all these years I came around to you. I like the way stuff worked out in the end. It still brings a smile to my face when I think how you had a crush on me at that age. Damn that was some serious plot twist. </div>

        <div id="slide4">
            <div class="left4"></div>
            <div class="right4">I like the way you make me happy when I am in the dump. I like the way you get jealous. I like how you say I love you without actually saying it. I like how you are not scared of being open about our relationship. I like how you become a little kid when you are with me. I like pampering you.
                You are everything that I ever wanted and I feel so so so lucky to have you in my life. Because of you, my each day is a little bit better. You make me smile like an idiot, even when you are not talking to me. Each song reminds me of you. I have never felt like this, and now I understand what people mean when they say love should be simple. Loving you is one of the easiest thing and never have I ever been more sure of something.
                <br><br>P.S:you kissed me so hard in this pic. Seeing it brings butterflies in my stomach.

                No one has ever loved me the way you did. You make me feel all so important and special and I feel respected and valued. I know I am not the easiest girl to be loved. I may get angry at you, I may yell at you, I cry for the silliest of things, my moods swings are like a roller coaster, and I know sometimes it isn't easy to understand me.
                Yet, you have done an excellent job in gracefully handling me, understanding me, staying there for me, and I couldn't imagine a person better at the job. So I promise you that once I give you my heart, it would always belong to you, no matter what.   
                <br><br>The way you took my hand and kissed, I still get all tingly thinking about it. Writing this right now makes my heart skip a beat. 
                <br><br>Every memory that we shared, are moments in my life that I would cherish forever. You lifted me to levels of happiness that I never thought I could ever get to. Just seeing you is enough to make my day better. Not a moment goes by without you in my mind.

               There was a time when I thought love was magical, like in fairy tales and movies. But then that got shattered and I was scared of love. Everything about it started to hurt me. I stopped believing in love, all afraid of getting my heart broken again. 
               For so long, I wondered if I would ever find someone capable of loving these broken pieces. But then, out of the blue, one crazy night, my love of icecreams brought me to you. It started as a kutti crush, and to be honest, I never thought then that it would turn out to be everything I had been
               looking for my whole life. You are everything that I wished for, but a 1000% better. Here we are, with our future before us and I only want to spend it with you, my best friend, my soulmate, my kunnuvaava &#128536;

              Over the past few months, I have expressed how much you mean to me. Its amusing how much love can change a person for the good. Eeran megham went from my lesser favourite to one among my top 10 melodies. Lightning against my windows started reminding me of your electric touches. I started loving the colour 
              brown because it reminded me of your eyes. For a girl who went to sleep at 10, 11:00 p.m. became her favourite time of the day. And do you know the best part? I started loving myself once again. I feel like I found myself once again. You make me a better version of myself.

                They say good things take time and now I believe they do. The way we stood the other day, your face in my hands, you sittng and me standing, looking deep into your eyes a warm autumn hue, at that moment, I knew every pain I went through was worth it. Like you said, maybe if we had met earlier, 
                we both wouldn't have suffered so much. But I guess that is the beauty of it. Looking back, I see a beautiful path woven by bad days and regrets just to lead it up to you. "The route always wasn't easy I swear, but the destination being you, I care no trouble. :)"

                I could go on and on. But that won't sum up anything about how high I think of you. <br>
                Stay cool. Stay lit. Be that kind hearted person you always were. Bag every single dream you think of. And show that third finger (from the left or right) to all the pricks that stand in your way. You know your heart, keep listening to it. Keep spreading that warm smile of yours.
                Thank you for being there for me. Thank you for listening to my rant and staying by my side keeping all things aside, for being a shade when I wanted it the most, for listening to my endless rubbish, for giving me a rainbow when I asked for a little sunshine. Thank you for being one of the most influential being in my life. Thankyou just for tolerating me. 
                <br><br>This is also a promise. I would always be there for you, no matter whatever happens. Just a phone call away.
                <br><br>This website would only last till 11:59p.m. on your birthday, beginning from today, 12:00 midnight. It would be taken down after that. Cuz I think the limited time would make it more valuable, just like the time we had together.
